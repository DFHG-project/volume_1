An appendix includes also the <i>Marmor Parium</i> and the Greek text of the <i>Marmor Rosettanum</i>.

`xml` files have been automatically generated from data stored in the DFHG database and are encoded in accordance with the CTS/CITE Architecture.
The repository contains two kinds of files arranged by DFHG authors:
* EpiDoc `xml` files that are encoded in accordance with EpiDoc standards and represent the structure of the edition of the FHG.
* Well formed `xml` files that collect information about fragments and extant texts collected in the FHG.
